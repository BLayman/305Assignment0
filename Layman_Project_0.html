<h2>Text editor</h2>
<p>I selected the Atom text editor. Here's the tutorial I completed: </p>
<a href="http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/">Atom Flight Manual Chapter 2</a>
<p>It covered shortcuts for cursor movement (using ctrl), selecting text (using shift), and deleting text.
<br>It also covered multiple cursors, find and replace, snippets, panes, git integration, and more.</p>
<br>
<h2>Version Control System</h2>
<p>For my VCS I chose Git. I worked through this tutorial: </p>
 <a href="http://jlord.us/git-it/">Git-it Tutorial</a>
<p>It went over: repositories, commits, GitHub, remotes, forks, branches, pushing, pulling, and merging.</p>
<br>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I'd like to read more about customizing Atom, and explore what packages could be useful to add.</li>
  <li>For Git, I think I need more practice with branches and integrating work from multiple contributors.</li>
  <li>I made a few commits in the beginning to practice using Git, and one at the end. Next time I think I'd do a commit after each section.</li>
</ul>
